Fix: zooming doesn't always maintain aspect ratio //GH
Fix: should be able to drag model from project view on to canvas
Fix: "use mask" checkbox doesn't do anything //GH

Fix: toolbar buttons should respect the current context (e.g. snapshot)
Fix: likewise, all controls should be disabled, grayed out when no image is loaded or selected
Fix: left/right keys always have focus and can mess things up //GH
Fix: z ordering doesn't respect display anatomy (instead seems to reflect the data anatomy) //GH

Fix: when layer is added to high res background, looks like nearest neighbor interpolation is used.
     But when slice is changed it changes to trilinear?  //GH


Potential Fix: when rotating layers, the "image space" of the model needs to be changed?

Fix: removing an image does not change color of entry in ImageFileExplorer.  // GH
Fix: removing an image fails to remove the model for the ProjectTreeView // GH

[Fix: unzooming so that field of view is larger than image bounds causes exception * simply disallowed unzooming for now]
[Fix: switching canvas should cause selection state of image view to update.]
[Fix: when new layer is added make it the selected layer automatically]
[Fix: when model changes project view fails to update.  Problem is
[Fix: Color range fails to update immediately on view change -- needed to add an explicit repaint though]

   1. Check that you’re running under Apple VM. Use System.getProperty("os.name") and check that the value starts with “Mac”.
   2. Set Aqua (or the future default Apple VM platform look-and-feel) with UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName()).
   3. Query and store the following UIManager entries: “MenuBarUI”, “MenuUI”, “MenuItemUI”, “CheckBoxMenuItemUI”, “RadioButtonMenuItemUI”, “PopupMenuUI”.
   4. Set your look-and-feel of preference with UIManager.setLookAndFeel call.
   5. Before creating your first window, restore the UIManager entries for the keys specified in the third step.  */
